         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur late experience of the wofull effects of War, raiſeth in us many moſt ſad conſiderations, and feares of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie continuance thereof, in this our deare Mother Kingdom; unto the prevention of whoſe Calamities, wee are aſſured that God, and Nature, by all Obligations humane, and divine, moſt ſtrictly bind us; In diſcharge therefore of this our duty unto God, and our Country, we doe in the preſence of God publiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, that we have already uſed, and ſhall forever hereafter uſe, the utmoſt of our endeavours, for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſettlement, and quiet of this diſtracted and bleeding Kingdome: In evidence whereof, we have heretofore humbly petitioned both Houſes of Parliament, for a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162066:3"/>ſpeedie Perſonall Treaty, betwixt his Majeſtie, and the two Houſes, (being the only, and ſo often by them ſelves acknowledged expedient, to eſtabliſh a ſafe, and well grounded peace) yet have been anſwered with ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated protractions and delayes, as gave us juſt cauſe to iudge, that all our Endeavours in this kind, would prove fruitleſſe, and that the over-ruling partie in both (Houſes never meant any ſuch thing: So that throughly obſerving all our pious endeavours, (with thoſe of others unto this purpoſe) herein fruſtrate, we could not bethink our ſelves of a more ſpeedie and effectuall courſe, to arrive at that bleſſed, and by us moſt deſired end; [the peace and proſperity of our Country] then by the rendition of our ſelves &amp; our returning unto our due Loyalty &amp; Obedience, unto his ſacred Maieſty, our dear Soveraign; (from whom we cannot without much ſorrow but acknowledge; that the ſubtile malice, &amp; many hypocritical pretentions, of his Maieſties moſt confirmed adverſaries did to long alien us.) And in Order unto that to reſtore unto his Maieſtie, as his moſt undoubted right) ſuch Veſſells of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Navie Royall, as were in our power, together with what Ships of defence we had of our own, being by this courſe hopefull to render his Maieſtie, (now ſuffering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unparalel'd Oppreſſions) and his affaires more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, unto ſuch as oppoſed him, and hereby the better to diſpoſe ſuch, unto more viſible tearmes of Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; that his Majeſtie might be reſtored unto his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable rights, and royall Prerogatives.</p>
            <p>And this; we profeſſe (before God) unto the whole world, that we could not but know and acknowleghe our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:162066:3"/>bounden duty, without a fearefull incurring within our own Conſciences, the ſecret ſentence of damnation; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by our Oaths, and ſo many ſacred Obligations, ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſworn and proteſted, the preſervation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſtabliſhed by Law, his Majeſties honour, perſon, and dignity, and the Liberty of the Subject. All which wee are accordingly reſolved, God aſſiſting, unto our utmoſt endeavours to preſerve, though with the apparent hazard of our lives and fortunes.</p>
            <p>And we doe hereby invite all Good Subiects, Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally our brethren the Sea Commanders, Marriners, and Seamen, unto a ſerious conſideration of their ſeverall and reſpective duties, unto theſe mentioned, great Intereſts, and conjure them with us vigorouſly to proſecute ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and honourable ends, unto which both God, Nature, and their ſo oft iterated Oaths, (then which nothing can more awe a good Chriſtian) moſt firmly bind them and from which, without manifeſt ſinning againſt their owne Conſciences, and the apparent loſſe even of their ſoules (which God forbid) they can no wayes recede; Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when their Adherence unto ſo good and juſt ends, may probably put a full period unto the preſent miſeries of this diſtreſſed Kingdome, or notably contribute unto ſo good a work; to provoke and annimate them unto the undertaking whereof with us, let them look upon the moſt deploreable condition of the preſent affaires in this Kingdome, let them behold the Proteſtant Religion, (in the religious exerciſe whereof God ſo mightily bleſſed our Kingdom, in the reign of K. <hi>Edward</hi> 6. in the happie dayes of never to be forgotten Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and in the good dayes of K. <hi>Iames</hi> of bleſſed memory) caſt out of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:162066:4"/>doores, and almoſt quite overgrown with Schiſmes and Hereſies.</p>
            <p>Behold his ſacred Maieſtie, moſt diſloyallie, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly caſt into priſon, and ſtricteſt durance; debarred the free exerciſe of his Religion, deprived of the ſociety of his beloved Queen, the comfort of his deare children, the attendance of his faithfull ſervants: Behold our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties trampled upon, and trodden underfoot, by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power of a party, ſupported by force, and an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of Sectaries, who have raiſed Exciſes, Taxations, free Quarter, and other unſupportable burthens upon us.</p>
            <p>Look upon the univerſal decay of forraign trade, wherby this Iſland ſo much flouriſhed, and became rich and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent above all Iſles, and a wonder and an Amazement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole world: what Country ſo ever we came to trade withall, we found this to be true: And now wee beſeech you Brethren, to look upon the ſad and ill favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red countenance of things amongſt our ſelves, and how many families in our profeſſion, are almoſt, or altogether impoveriſhed, by the decay of forraign Traffique, and Trade, which is in a preſent poſſibility to be quite loſt unto us and our whole Nation, and to be ſeized upon by Strangers. And that through the continuance of this moſt unnaturall war, which kept up, will bring utter ruin, and deſolation unto this late flouriſhing Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Two Armies are already entred into the Bowells of the Kingdom, and two more neare the entring, whence Trade both by Sea and Land will be ſo obſtructed, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:162066:4"/>it will be impoſſible to trade with any ſecurity, which as it will be unto the exceeding Impoveriſhment of the people of this Kingdome, ſo eſpecially unto thoſe of our profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider, that the perſons from whom all theſe Evills come upon us, are ſome few in the Houſe of Lords, and ſome of the Houſe of Commons, and their <hi>Creatures, Exciſe-men, Farmers, Purchaſers,</hi> of <hi>Biſhops</hi> Lands, and the <hi>Committees</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes:</hi> Such as have cheated this Kingdome of many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and now fearing they ſhould be called unto an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, will not be brought to heare of a perſonal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or any courſe which may bring peace unto this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Nation; Leaſt their horrid Impoſture, and Coz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, wherewith they have abuſed the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, ſhould be reckoned for; to decline which by the Purſe of the Commonwealth, (which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) they maintain an Army of deſperate Sectaries, to uphold themſelves, and oppreſſe our Religion, King, and Kingdome.</p>
            <p>There is no way, or meanes under Heaven, left you or us, to reſtore peace unto this afflicted Kingdom, to reſtore our Religion unto its auncient luſture and beauty his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty unto his Rights, and our ſelves unto our libertyes, then by adhereing unto his highneſſe the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> who is willing to venture his deareſt blood to preſerve ours; nay there is no other way left unto you to ſave your Soules; For if you will not keep inviolable your juſt Oathes, you run the Hazard of certaine damnation, The
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:162066:5"/>Conſideration whereof is fearfull, and calls upon you for a preſent reſolution: Which if ſuch as becomes you, you will forthwith repair unto the Navy, and Fleet with his highnes Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> &amp; in the beſt manner you may, tender your loyall Services unto him, for the good Ends mentioned, which if you ſhall do, aſſure your ſelves, you ſhall not only performe an Act exceedingly acceptable unto his Majeſty, and his Highneſſe, worthy of your ſelves and moſt deſired by us; but alſo pleaſing unto God, as being your bounden duty, what he requires at your hands, and the neglect whereof he will grievouſly puniſh.</p>
            <p>This duty of your loyallty we expect from you, and if you ſhall any wayes decline it, know aſſuredly, that as we are able, ſo we are reſolved to debar you of all benefit of forraign trade, and to deale with you as profeſſed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto your King, and Country, the very thought whereof ought to be moſt odious unto every honeſt man, and contrary unto whom we doubt not, you will always ſhew your ſelves.</p>
